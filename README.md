# 2D-Graphics-Lib

This is a C++ 2D graphics library that supports a standard Porter/Duff blending system, multiple shader systems, a shape system (convex polygons, path scanning, edge clipping, Bezier curves and meshes) and a coordinate transformation system.

To see examples, run make and then ./image.
